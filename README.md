RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program – VSD

RISC-V VSD Participants – India

Welcome to my journey through the SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)!
This repository documents my week-by-week progress, with detailed tasks and key learnings for each stage.

📖 About the Program

In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.

This initiative is part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout program, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and contribute to strengthening India’s semiconductor ecosystem.

📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools
Task	Description	Status
Task 0	🛠️ Tools Installation — Installed Icarus Verilog, Yosys, and GTKWave	✅ Done
🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0

Installed and verified essential open-source EDA tools successfully.

Gained familiarity with environment setup for RTL design and synthesis.

Prepared the system for upcoming RTL → GDSII flow experiments.

🙏 Acknowledgment

I sincerely thank Kunal Ghosh and the VLSI System Design (VSD) team for creating this opportunity to be part of the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.

I also acknowledge the support of RISC-V International, India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), VLSI Society of India (VSI), and Efabless for enabling this national-level initiative.
